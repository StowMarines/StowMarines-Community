# StowMarines-Community
This project manages all of the issues and recommendations that are brought up by the community. It will allow us to give a fair response to each user in a formal manner and allow users to see if an issue has already been brought up. Furthermore, it will allow leadership and other staff members the ability to track their progress on certain matters.
